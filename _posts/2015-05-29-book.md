Three new books today. S, Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionay( Dictionary is a book? ), Song of ice and fire 1-7( a big guy ).

I had a Oxford Advanced Learner's English-Chinese Dictionary, I want to try one English Dictionary, not English-Chinese.

The novel, song of ice and fire, is great. I had seen the movie before. And now, I bought it to improve my writing.

S, for my GF. She like it.
